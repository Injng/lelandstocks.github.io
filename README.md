# Leland High School's Stock Trading Leaderboard
The investopedia one was really slow to update (sometimes taking 2 weeks!). I wanted near real time leaderboard updates, making this cooler.


## How to Use?
First, using your own browser (will hopefully be fixed in a future update), download the entire leaderboard as html. For the 128 players, this was 3 pages of 50 leaderboards. Notably, you only have to do this once!

Then, fill out the .env.example file with your login credentials, and the number of leaderboards (and rename it to .env).

then simply run `pixi run all`
